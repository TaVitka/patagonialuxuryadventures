      Visa Types:

    <ol>
      <li>
        Tourist Visa (Short-Term Stay): This visa allows visitors to enter Argentina for tourism purposes, such as
        sightseeing, visiting friends or relatives, or participating in cultural events. It typically permits stays of
        up
        to 90 days.
      </li>

      <li>
        Business Visa: Business travelers intending to engage in commercial activities, attend meetings, or explore
        business opportunities in Argentina may require a business visa. This visa usually allows for short-term stays

      Specific Requirements:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Reciprocity Fee: Some nationalities are required to pay a reciprocity fee before entering Argentina. This fee is
        based on the principle of reciprocity and applies to citizens of countries that charge Argentine citizens a
        similar fee for visas. The fee amount and affected nationalities may change, so visitors should check the latest
        requirements before traveling.
      </li>

      <li>
        Visa Exemptions: Argentina maintains visa exemption agreements with certain countries, allowing their citizens
        to
        enter for tourism or business purposes without obtaining a visa in advance. The length of stay permitted under
        visa exemptions varies depending on nationality.
      </li>

      <li>
        Additional Documentation: Visitors may be required to provide additional documentation, such as proof of
        accommodation, return flight tickets, sufficient funds for their stay, and travel insurance coverage.
      </li>
