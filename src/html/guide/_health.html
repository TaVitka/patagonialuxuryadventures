      Health Tips for Travelers:
    </h4>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Vaccinations:</b>

        Before traveling to Patagonia, ensure that routine vaccinations are up-to-date. Depending on your itinerary and
        activities, additional vaccinations such as hepatitis A, hepatitis B, typhoid, and rabies may be recommended.
        Consult with a healthcare provider or travel medicine specialist for personalized advice.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Food and Water Safety:</b>

        Stick to bottled or purified water and avoid consuming tap water, ice cubes, and unpasteurized dairy products to
        prevent gastrointestinal illnesses. Eat thoroughly cooked foods and opt for hot, freshly prepared meals from
        reputable establishments. Wash hands frequently, especially before eating, to minimize the risk of
        contamination.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Altitude Sickness:</b>

        Patagonia's high-altitude regions, such as Torres del Paine and El Chalt√©n, may pose a risk of altitude
        sickness. Take gradual acclimatization measures, stay hydrated, and avoid overexertion upon arrival.
        Over-the-counter medications like acetazolamide can help alleviate symptoms if necessary.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Sun Protection:</b>

        Patagonia's southern latitude means exposure to intense sunlight, even in cooler temperatures. Wear sunscreen
        with a high SPF, protective clothing, and sunglasses to shield against sunburn and UV radiation, especially at
        high altitudes or near water.
